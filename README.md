# My Programming Challenges

This repository contains all programming challenges I did in the past years:

- [Advent Of Code](./aoc)
- [LeetCode](./leetcode)
- [Project Euler](./euler)
- [99 Problems](./99problems)
- [Google Kickstart](./kickstart)

I try to solve every problem in Haskell. If the challenge won't accept Haskell answers, 
I fallback to Scala, Rust or Python.

I try to emphasize readability over performance.
