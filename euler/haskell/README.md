# Haskell Solutions to Project Euler

If you don't know what Project Euler is, you can have a look at [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net).
It's a coding challenge mostly containing algorithmic and number theory problems.

This repository contains all my attempts to solve the problems in the [Haskell programming language](https://www.haskell.org).

## Running a Problem

For each problem there is an executable that prints the solution to your terminal.
To run the solution to problem 1 run:

```
stack run problem1
```

To run the solution to problem 2 run:

```
stack run problem2
```

I hope you get the idea.
